Women in India in 2014 likely spent more than men due to several societal and economic factors:  

1. **Household Management Role**: Women traditionally manage household expenses, including bills, groceries, and food, which are significant contributors to overall expenditure.  

2. **Spending on Family Needs**: Women may prioritize expenditures related to the family, such as education, healthcare, and daily essentials, leading to higher spending levels.  

3. **Urbanization and Employment**: With increasing urbanization and more women joining the workforce, they may have gained greater financial independence, leading to increased spending power.  

4. **Cultural Norms**: In some regions, women are responsible for organizing festivals, ceremonies, and family events, which can increase their spending.  

5. **Consumer Patterns**: Women might spend more on diverse needs such as personal care, family necessities, and leisure, compared to men focusing on selective categories like fuel or travel.  

These factors combined contribute to the observed higher expenditures by women in 2014.
